# Python-Assignment-4
My Assignment for python in week 4
In this assignment I created a program that asks the user to enter name of a file to open it.
The correct name of file is names.txt
If user inputs a wrong name, the program returns an error message.
The program also modifies the file to a new file named names_upper.txt which is in Uppercase.
